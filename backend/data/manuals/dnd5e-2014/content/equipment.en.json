It paraphrases the D&D 5e SRD 5.1 (2014) in a concise, reader-friendly way.\n\n## Wealth\n- The standard currency is coins: copper (cp), silver (sp), electrum (ep), gold (gp), and platinum (pp).\n- Typical conversions: 10 cp = 1 sp, 5 sp = 1 ep, 10 sp = 1 gp, 10 gp = 1 pp.\n- A common assumption is that 50 coins weigh about 1 lb (table-ready abstraction).\n\n### Currency Conversion (quick view)\n\n| From | To | Rate |\n|------|----|------|\n| cp   | sp | 10 cp = 1 sp |\n| sp   | ep | 5 sp = 1 ep  |\n| sp   | gp | 10 sp = 1 gp |\n| gp   | pp | 10 gp = 1 pp |\n\n## Adventuring Gear (sample prices)\nThese sample prices are indicative; consult the full SRD for complete lists.\n\n| Item             | Price | Weight | Notes                      |\n|------------------|-------|--------|----------------------------|\n| Rations (1 day)  | 5 sp  | 2 lb   | Dry food for travel        |\n| Torch            | 1 cp  | 1 lb   | Burns 1 hour, 20-ft bright |\n| Rope (hempen, 50 ft) | 1 gp  | 10 lb  | Can be knotted, sturdy     |\n| Waterskin        | 2 sp  | 5 lb   | Weight when full           |\n| Tinderbox        | 5 sp  | 1 lb   | Start a fire with effort   |\n\n## Armor\nArmor improves your Armor Class (AC) but can impose Strength requirements and Stealth disadvantage. Proficiency avoids penalties.\n\n### Armor Summary (by category)\n\n| Category | Base AC            | Dex Bonus         | Stealth        | Str Req | Notes            |\n|----------|--------------------|-------------------|----------------|---------|------------------|\n| Light    | 11–12 + Dex mod    | Full Dex applies  | Normal         | —       | Padded/leather   |\n| Medium   | 12–14 + Dex (max +2)| Up to +2 Dex      | Varies         | —       | Hide/scale/half  |\n| Heavy    | 16–18 (fixed)      | None              | Disadvantage   | 13–15   | Ring/chain/plate |\n| Shield   | +2 AC              | —                 | —              | —       | When wielded     |\n\nWearing armor you lack proficiency with imposes disadvantage on many Str/Dex checks, Str/Dex/Con saves to maintain concentration, and prevents casting with somatic/material components.\n\n### Armor Items (SRD)\n\n| Armor           | Category | Base AC           | Dex Bonus        | Stealth      | Str Req | Weight | Price |\n|-----------------|----------|-------------------|------------------|--------------|---------|--------|-------|\n| Padded          | Light    | 11 + Dex          | Full             | Disadvantage | —       | 8 lb   | 5 gp  |\n| Leather         | Light    | 11 + Dex          | Full             | Normal       | —       | 10 lb  | 10 gp |\n| Studded Leather | Light    | 12 + Dex          | Full             | Normal       | —       | 13 lb  | 45 gp |\n| Hide            | Medium   | 12 + Dex (max +2) | Up to +2         | Normal       | —       | 12 lb  | 10 gp |\n| Chain Shirt     | Medium   | 13 + Dex (max +2) | Up to +2         | Normal       | —       | 20 lb  | 50 gp |\n| Scale Mail      | Medium   | 14 + Dex (max +2) | Up to +2         | Disadvantage | —       | 45 lb  | 50 gp |\n| Breastplate     | Medium   | 14 + Dex (max +2) | Up to +2         | Normal       | —       | 20 lb  | 400 gp|\n| Half Plate      | Medium   | 15 + Dex (max +2) | Up to +2         | Disadvantage | —       | 40 lb  | 750 gp|\n| Ring Mail       | Heavy    | 14                | None             | Disadvantage | —       | 40 lb  | 30 gp |\n| Chain Mail      | Heavy    | 16                | None             | Disadvantage | Str 13  | 55 lb  | 75 gp |\n| Splint          | Heavy    | 17                | None             | Disadvantage | Str 15  | 60 lb  | 200 gp|\n| Plate           | Heavy    | 18                | None             | Disadvantage | Str 15  | 65 lb  | 1500 gp|\n| Shield          | Shield   | +2 AC             | —                | —            | —       | 6 lb   | 10 gp |\n\n## Weapons\nWeapons are simple or martial; each has properties like Light, Finesse, Heavy, Reach, Thrown, Versatile, Ammunition, Loading, Two-Handed, and sometimes Special.

Draft animals and vehicles can haul more at the cost of upkeep.\n\n## Encumbrance (Variant)\nBy default, the game abstracts encumbrance. A variant rule can track weight carried against Strength score to impose speed penalties.\n\n> Notes:\n> - Prices and examples above are not exhaustive; see the full SRD or the Player’s Handbook for comprehensive tables.\n> - Abbreviations: B/P/S = bludgeoning/piercing/slashing.\n",
